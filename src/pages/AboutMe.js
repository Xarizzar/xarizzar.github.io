            <p>Hi! My name is Xarizzar Phantasma! Some people also call me Kuro (AKA çŽ„), which is my original character's name!
                I'm aspiring to be a game developer! I'm already writing a small, custom game engine in C++, along with aiming to
                get better at art and starting music composing! I also like playing JRPGs, maybe some Final Fantasy XIV for MMOs
                and also some Splatoon. My favorite games of all time include but are not limited to Trials of Mana (2D/SNES/NS),
                Chrono series, Final Fantasy series (mostly VI, IX, IV), and more. I'm autistic, so I often have trouble understanding
                other people's feelings and expressing myself, so I apologize in advance for this.
            </p>
